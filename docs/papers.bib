  abstract = {New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a novel β-lactamase enzyme that confers enteric bacteria with nearly complete resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, so it raises a formidable and global threat to human health. However, the binding mechanism between apo-NDM-1 and antibiotics as well as related conformational changes remains poorly understood, which largely hinders the overcoming of its antibiotic resistance. In our study, long-time conventional molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state models were applied to reveal both the dynamical and conformational landscape of apo-NDM-1: the MD simulation demonstrates that loop L3, which is responsible for antibiotic binding, is the most flexible and undergoes dramatic conformational changes; moreover, the Markov state model built from the simulation maps four metastable states including open, semiopen, and closed conformations of loop L3 as well as frequent transitions between the states. Our findings propose a possible conformational selection model for the binding mechanism between apo-NDM-1 and antibiotics, which facilitates the design of novel inhibitors and antibiotics.}

  journal = {Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation},
  abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful enhanced molecular dynamics sampling method that accelerates simulations by adding history-dependent multidimensional Gaussians along selective collective variables (CVs). In practice, choosing a small number of slow CVs remains challenging due to the inherent high dimensionality of biophysical systems. Here we show that time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA), a recent advance in Markov state model literature, can be used to identify a set of variationally optimal slow coordinates for use as CVs for Metadynamics. We show that linear and nonlinear tICA-Metadynamics can complement existing MD studies by explicitly sampling the system’s slowest modes and can even drive transitions along the slowest modes even when no such transitions are observed in unbiased simulations.}
